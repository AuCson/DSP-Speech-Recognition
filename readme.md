# Digital Signal Processing - Speech Recognition

COMP130139.01 Digital Signal Processing（数字信号处理） Course Project. 20-word(tiny!) speech recognition, which includes very confusing word pairs.

- Classifier:
  - RNN
  - Hierarchical RNN
  - Hierarchical Multiscale RNN
  - SVM(for pitch features)
  
- Features:
  - MFCC, delta MFCC
  - Pitch features computed based on cepstrums and auto-correlation

- Other:
  - Endpoint detection
  - Adversarial feature distilling(domain adaptation for speakers)
  - Ensembled models

- Accuracy: 
  - 97.1% on development set.
